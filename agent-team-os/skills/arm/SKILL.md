# Arm what was approved

A workflow file says *this job should happen at 06:30*. A routine is the alarm clock that
actually rings. Nothing connects them until somebody arms one, and until then the file is a wish.

This is the command that closes that gap — deliberately, one job at a time, with a human saying
yes to each.

**Say this out loud once:** nothing runs because it looked useful. It runs because they approved
the reason it runs, and every job left off keeps a written reason too.

## Before you start

Three things, and the first one is a blocker.

1. **They need to know their run cap.** Arming spends runs on a schedule, forever, whether or not
   anyone reads the output. If they cannot say how many scheduled runs their plan includes, stop
   and send them to `claude.ai/settings/usage`. Do not guess it, and do not arm "just one to see".
   **If they are on an employer's Team plan, say that part of the cap may be shared with
   colleagues** and that the usage page shows their own account, not the pool - so the number
   they read is a floor, not a budget.
2. `proposals.yml` must exist and pass `npm run check:proposals`. You arm what was approved, and
   approval lives in that file. **An empty proposals list is a valid file that approves nothing** -
   common for anyone who works for someone else, whose week the shipped jobs were not built for.
   If that is where they are, arm nothing, write the reasons, and say plainly that this is a
   finished lesson rather than a blocked one.
3. Run `/routines` first so you both know what already exists. Arming a second routine for a job
   that already has one is how a daily brief starts arriving twice.

**And one question, once, before the first job:** *"Is this business yours, or do you work for
someone else?"* If they work for someone else, say plainly that the routine will live on their
personal account, spend their allowance, and be invisible to everyone they work with - so it
stops the day they do. That is not a reason to skip it. It is a reason to arm something that
briefs them rather than something a colleague will come to depend on without knowing it exists.

## 1. Compare the two lists

From the team repo:

```bash
npm run check:arming
```

That reads the snapshot safely - on a fresh clone, where `.agent-team/routines.json` does not
exist yet, it says so instead of crashing - and prints four lists. Two of them cost something:

| | What it means | What it costs |
|---|---|---|
| **armed** | The file says run it, and a routine exists | Runs, on schedule |
| **declared** | The file says run it, and **nothing rings** | Nothing. It is a wish. |
| **unapproved** | A routine **rings**, and the file says it is off | Runs nobody approved |
| **off** | Deliberately not armed, with a written reason | Nothing, honestly |

**If it says there is no usable snapshot, run `/routines` first.** Without one this can only report
what the files claim, and a file claiming a schedule is the exact thing you came here to check.

Plus **orphans**: routines pointing at this repo with no workflow file behind them. Report those;
do not act on them.

**`declared` is the bug this whole build exists to kill.** This repo describes nine jobs against
one real alarm clock, and every board reading those files cheerfully reported nine jobs running.
If anything is in `declared`, say the number out loud before you do anything else.

**`unapproved` is the same bug pointing the other way, and it is the expensive one.** Something is
firing that the file never approved - real runs, spent every day, on a job nobody said yes to.
Say that number out loud too, and say what it is costing.

## 2. Arm one, and only what they approved

For each job they say yes to:

```
RemoteTrigger {
  action: "create",
  name: "<workflow name>",
  schedule: "<the workflow's own schedule>",
  prompt: "<what the job should do, from the workflow file>",
  repo: "<owner>/<repo>",
  model: "<the owner agent's model, from shared/standards/model-card.md>",
  mcp_connections: [<only the connectors whose used_by names this workflow; [] for none>]
}
```

**Name the connectors, every time, even when the answer is none.** A create that leaves them out
gets every connector on the account, with write access: on 2026-09-24 two weekly jobs that only
read their own repo were created holding a student's n8n, ClickUp and drive. The list comes from
`connections/register.yml`: a connector whose `used_by` names this workflow, and nothing else.

Then, in the same breath:

```
RemoteTrigger { action: "list" }
```

**A create you did not confirm did not happen.** The call returning without an error is not the
same as a routine existing, and this is exactly the class of claim the rest of this system refuses
to make. Confirm it, and read its `mcp_connections` and model back while you are there: if either
is not what you asked for, fix it with an update before the routine's first run, a test run
included. Then set `armed: true` in the workflow file and commit.

Arm them **one at a time**, confirming each. Not in a batch. A batch that half-fails leaves a repo
whose files disagree with reality, which is the state you were called here to fix.

## 3. Write the reason for everything left off

Every job not armed gets `armed: false` and a `reason:` in its own file:

```yaml
trigger:
  schedule: "daily 06:30"
  armed: false
  reason: "Left off until the run cap is known - nobody reads a second daily brief anyway"
```

The file stays. Nothing is deleted. One line changes later when they want it on.

**And when you DO arm one, delete its `reason:`.** The reason says why it is off; leaving it behind
prints a job under "Armed" with "Off until you know your run cap" underneath it.

A reason is required and it is checked. "Not needed" is not a reason — say what would have to
change for it to be worth a run.

## 4. Read it back

> "You have N jobs armed, spending N runs a week. M are switched off, and here is why each one is.
> Nothing else in the repo is pretending to run."

## Check

- [ ] They said their run cap out loud before anything was armed
- [ ] Every armed job traces back to a line in `proposals.yml`, and you named which line
- [ ] Every armed job was confirmed present by a `list` after its `create`
- [ ] Every armed job has `armed: true` in its file, committed
- [ ] Every job left off has `armed: false` **and a written reason**, committed
- [ ] `declared` is empty — nothing claims a schedule that no routine backs
- [ ] `unapproved` is empty — nothing is firing that the file never approved
- [ ] `npm run check:arming` exits clean — a declared job is a problem, so this cannot pass while
      any job claims a schedule nothing backs
- [ ] Orphan routines were reported, not silently adopted

## What this skill must never do

- **Never arm anything their ledger did not ask for.** Concretely, a workflow is armable when
  `proposals.yml` names it as `workflow:<slug>`, **or** when its `steps:` are skills approved
  there as `skill:<slug>`, **or** when its `owner:` is an agent approved there as `agent:<slug>`.
  Anything else was not approved, and it does not run.

  **`npm run check:arming` now enforces this rather than trusting you.** It refuses an armed job
  that traces back to nothing, by name, and reports "UNKNOWN" rather than approval when there is
  no `proposals.yml` at all. This used to be a rule only this file knew, on the single step in the
  chain that spends money - every other link was re-derived and compared.

  This matters because most proposals name a **skill** or an **agent**, not a workflow — a
  proposal is a decision about *work*, and a workflow is how that work gets a clock. `/new-workflow`
  is the step in between. A student who approved `skill:triage-inbox` on Monday and chained it
  into `inbox-triage` on Wednesday has approved that job; say so out loud when you arm it, naming
  the proposal line it traces back to. If a workflow traces back to nothing in `proposals.yml`,
  do not arm it — ask them to run `/match` again now that the job exists.
- **Never arm in a batch.** One at a time, each confirmed.
- **Never claim a routine exists without a `list` that shows it.**
- **Never delete a routine.** The API has no delete — only `claude.ai/code/routines` can. Say that
  plainly rather than pretending to remove something.
- **Never leave a job off without a reason.** An unexplained silence is indistinguishable from a
  mistake six weeks later.
- **Never guess the run cap.** It is the one number that decides whether any of this is affordable.
